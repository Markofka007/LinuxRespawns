# LinuxRespawns
Bash scripts that automatically install all the basic tools I need for small a variety of Linux distros that I use.
This is a small personal project.
Currently I have a respawn script for Linux Mint, but I plan on making one for Tails and Kali as well.

## Usage:
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Markofka007/LinuxRespawns/main/MintRespawn.sh)"`
OR
```
wget https://github.com/Markofka007/LinuxRespawns/raw/main/MintRespawn.sh
chmod +x MintRespawn.sh
./MintRespawn.sh
```
