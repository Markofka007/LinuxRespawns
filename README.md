# LinuxRespawns
Bash scripts that automatically install all the basic tools I need for small a variety of Linux distros that I use.
This is a small personal project.
Currently I have a respawn script for Linux Mint, but I plan on making one for Tails and Kali as well.

# Usage:
`wget https://github.com/TheBigCarrot/LinuxRespawns/raw/main/name-of-script.sh`\n
`chmod +x name-of-script.sh`\n
`./name-of-script.sh`
